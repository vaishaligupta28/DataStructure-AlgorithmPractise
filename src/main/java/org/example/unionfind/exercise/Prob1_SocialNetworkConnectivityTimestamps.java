 *
 * Problem Statement 1 : Social network connectivity
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Given a social network containing ùëõ members and a log file containing ùëö timestamps at which times pairs of members
 * formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
 * (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).
 * Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation.
 * The running time of your algorithm should be ùëölogùëõ or better and use extra space proportional to ùëõ.
 *
 * Solution Summary :
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * For all members of the friendship network to be connected together they need to be part of
 * a single tree such that the topmost parent of each member is same.
 *
 * What is given to us is below ---
 * - We know which pairs get connected at what timestamps and how many transactions have occurred i.e M.
 * - We know the log data is also sorted as per timestamp so transactions are logged from earliest to latest.
 * - We also know that the friendship network also form an equivalence relation which means if A is connected to B and B is connected to C, then A is also connected to C.
 *
 * With the above given requirements the closest data structure that can be used for this scenario is Union Find DSA.
 * We can start from the 0th transaction unto M transactions that can be added in the network by performing
 * a `union` operation using Weighted QuickUnion approach.
 * Now as we said to know if all members are connected, they all need to have same root which means
 * the size of the root index has to be equal to N for it to have N members connected to it.
 *
 * Since in WeightedQuickUnion, we keep updating the size of the merged root, we already keep track of the resulting
 * root's size to decide which is the smaller entity to be merged under the larger one.
 * So whenever we reach a point when the size of the resulting root after doing the union becomes equal to N,
 * then we know that this is the transaction when all members got connected and the timestamp respective is the earliest time when it happened.
 *
 * Time complexity Analysis :
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Since weighted quick union's worst time complexity is O(logN) and since we might have to in do in worst case M transactions
 * so for the complete algorithm it would take O (M logN).
 * And we use extra space proportional to N for maintaining the size of each the members.
