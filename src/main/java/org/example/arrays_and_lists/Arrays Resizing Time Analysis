Resizing approaches:
    - Approach1
        Creating a new array everytime and copying all elements from prev array
        to new array each time we add new elements.

        Time Complexity Analysis -
        --------------------------
            Adding 1st element with initial array is of size 1, then -- newly added 1
            Adding 2nd element a new array is created of size 2 is created -- elements copied 1 and newly added
            Adding 3rd element a new array is created of size 3 is created -- elements copied 2 and newly added 1
            Adding 4th element a new array is created of size 4 is created -- elements copied 3 and newly added 1

            Adding Nth element a new array is created of size N is created -- elements copied N-1 and newly added 1

            Total time taken to insert N elements(including resizing and copying elements)
                    = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + .......... N) = N(N+1)/2 = O(N^2 /2) ~ O(N^2)

        Very expensive operation especially copying and creating new arrays.

    - Approach2: Repeated Doubling
        Creating a new array with twice the size of the prev array
        and copying elements from prev array only when the ((array is full)).


        Time Complexity Analysis -
        --------------------------
            Adding 1st element with initial array is of size 1, then -- newly added 1
            Adding 2nd element a new array is created of size 2 is created -- elements copied 1 and newly added
            Adding 3rd element a new array is created of size 4 is created -- elements copied 2 and newly added 1
            Adding 4th element same array is used -- newly added 1

            Adding 5th element a new array is created of size 8 is created -- elements copied 4 and newly added 1
            Adding 6th element same array is used -- newly added 1
            Adding 7th element same array is used -- newly added 1
            Adding 8th element same array is used -- newly added 1

            Adding 9th element a new array is created of size 16 is created -- elements copied 4 and newly added 1

            Adding Nth element a new array is created of size N is created -- elements copied N-1 and newly added 1

            Total time taken to insert N elements(including resizing and copying elements)
                    = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + .......... N) = N(N+1)/2 = O(N^2 /2) ~ O(N^2)
