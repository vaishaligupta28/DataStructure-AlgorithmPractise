/**
 * Problem Statement 2: Search in a bitonic array
 *
 * An array is bitonic if it comprises an increasing sequence of integers
 * followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.
 *
 * Write a program that, given a bitonic array of ùëõ distinct integer values,
 * determines whether a given integer is in the array.
 *
 * Signing bonus: Use ‚àº2logN compares in the worst case
 * (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than ‚àº2logN compares in the worst case).
 *
 *
 *
 * Solution Summary :
 *
 * In this optimised version of the algorithm we are trying to find the bitonic intersection point while
 * simultaneously chcking for the searchValue and logically selecting the portion of the bitonic array based
 * on where the searchValue lies.
 *
 * - At the start we just find a mid of the bitonic array.
 *
 * - Now check if the mid of the bitonic array is in the increasing sequence or decreasing sequence
 * by checking it with its prev value. If prev < mid, it is in increasing sequence,
 * otherwise it is in the decreasing sequence.
 *
 * - If the mid is in increasing sequence and searchValue is greater than mid then value is found in the right sub array.
 * - If the mid is in decreasing sequence and searchValue is greater than mid then value is found in the left sub array.
 * - So in both cases we keep finding the bitonic intersection point. [bitonicSearch]
 *
 *
 * - If the mid is in increasing/ or decreasing sequence and searchValue is less than mid
 * then value can be found anywhere in the right or left sub array. Hence, we have to check in both.
 *
 * - Interesting point : When the searchValue is less than mid in such cases there is a chance that we
 * will have to perform a binary search on a bitonic array.
 *  For instance, doing an ascending binary search for the value 5 in the array [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7]
 *  will work because 7 and 8 are bigger than the desired value 5.
