Riddle 1: Egg drop riddle with 2 eggs and n floors

Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs.
An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise.

Find the highest floor i.e a (t-1) from which egg can be dropped without breaking with the least amount of tries
considering we have only 2 eggs.

Let's consider n to be 100.


Solution1:
Linear Search from 0 to 100 keep dropping till egg till you reach a floor where it does.
The floor below this one is our answer.
Worst case it would take 100 tries with 1 egg.
We have still not utilised 1 egg and what if we have millions of floors this will be very expensive.

Solution2:
We can try going for binary search from 0 to 100.
With binary search we start with mid i.e. 50th floor where we break the egg for the first time.
If egg breaks then we know the highest floor lies somewhere below it and if it does not it lies above it.

Let's say egg breaks so now we have 1 egg remaining and 50 floors i.e 0 - 50 to check.
We can repeat the binary search and go to 25th position but this time if the egg breaks then we will have no remaining eggs
to get to our highest floor so we cannot do a binary search again.
Hence we have to go with a linear search from 0 to 50 floors.

Therefore, in worst case we will take n/2 i.e. 50 tries minimum with 2 eggs.
Nothing really improves here since it is still in order of n so if n is millions then n/2 is also a lot of tries.

Solution3:
Another solution which is interesting that follows the above solution slightly such that in prev case
we started with 50th position i.e. the mid of the total floors
How about we decrease this chunk to a smaller area.

Since we have taken n as 100
How about if we can start from 10th floor and jump 10 times to reach the highest floor.

So with this solution after moving x jumps we will a reach a 10*xth floor where the egg will break
and just before it at 10(x-1) egg would not have broken.

Now we know our highest floor lies somewhere in the middle.
So we search from 10(x-1) to 10(x) which will take 9 steps if we go linearly with 1 egg.

So in total number of steps taken would be 10+9 = 19 steps which is decent not bad at all.
We have come down from 100 to 50 to 19 now.

Solution4:
Do we have a better solution? Yes.
Since we decrease the number of steps from 50 to 10 and after decreasing the jump size,
we somehow were able to get to a more optimum solution

Now there is a better way we can deal with it,

How about we first start with x steps, then go another x-1 steps, then go another x-3 steps such that we reach 100.
Now can we calculate this x? Yes

   = x + x-1 + x-2 + x-3 + ........... + 2 + 1 = 100;
   = x(x+1)/2 = 100
   = x = 13.65 ~14

   With this we are able to get the highest floor only with 14 steps which is the best most efficient way.
